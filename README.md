# Dataset Tag Editor for Stable Diffusion Forge

**An extension for [Stable Diffusion Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge) to efficiently manage and edit tags (`.txt`, `.caption`) for your image datasets.**

This is a fork of [toshiaki1729's Dataset Tag Editor](https://github.com/toshiaki1729/stable-diffusion-webui-dataset-tag-editor), adapted and maintained for compatibility with the Stable Diffusion Forge UI.

Stop juggling separate text files and image viewers! This extension integrates tag editing directly into your Forge workflow, saving you time and effort when preparing datasets for Dreambooth, LoRA training, or general organization.
